PROFILE SETUP INSTALL AND CONFIGURATION

The profile setup module for Drupal 6 integrates with the pageroute module to give site admins the ultimate flexibility when creating a profile setup workflow because they can choose to use any type of profile "user" or "content or node" profiles.

CONFIGURATION STEPS
1) Install the module as normal

2) Install the pageroute module

3) Use the pageroute module and the profile_setup pageroute pages to create a profile setup workflow, see http://drupal.org/node/310795 for more help with the pageroute module.

The profile_setup module provides 3 forms/page types for the pageroute module:
- profile picture upload form : allows users to upload a profile picture
- change username form : allows users to change their username
- account category forms : provides the option to create a form from each of profile "edit" sub sections.
  * Using Content Profile Module: If you are using Content Profile you much select Show a secondary tab below the user's edit tab under     Profile edit tab in the content profile content type tab per content type.
  * Using Profile Module: If you are using core Profile account categories are automatically created as you create profile fields. 

4) Once you have created your pageroute workflow navigate to the profile_setup configuration pages @ Administer > User Management > Profile Setup and select the pageroute "route" or workflow you want to use from the profile setup workflow.
You could optionally make a different pageroute per user role and use the rules module to redirect users based on their user role when they register.

5) Grant the "use profile setup" permission to users who should be able to use the profile setup workflow

6) IMPORTANT!
@ Administer > User Management > User Settings
Uncheck the "Require e-mail verification when a visitor creates an account" checkbox so that users are logged in straight after registeration
(TODO: Need to make this redirect work after email validation too)

The profile setup will automatically redirect users when they first register but you can overide this using the rules module.
